The package *eDNAjoint* is useful for interpreting observations from paired environmental DNA (eDNA) and traditional surveys. The package runs a Bayesian model that integrates these two data streams to jointly estimate parameters like the false positive probability of eDNA detection and expected catch rate at a site. Optional model variations allow inclusion of site-level covariates that scale the sensitivity of eDNA sampling relative to traditional sampling, as well as estimation of catchability coefficients when multiple traditional gear types are used. Additional functions in the package facilitate interpretation of model fits.

## Installation

You can install the development version of eDNAjoint:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github('abigailkeller/eDNAjoint')
```

## Example

The main functionality in *eDNAjoint* is the use of `jointModel()` that will fit the model to data. Further functions like `jointSummarize()` and `detectionCalculate()` can be used to help with model fit interpretation.

This example fits the joint model to data from paired, replicated eDNA qPCR and seine sampling observations of endangered tidewater gobies (*Eucyclogobius newberryi*) from a study by Schmelzle and Kinziger (2016). The following variation of the joint model includes site-level covariates that scale the sensitivity of eDNA sampling relative to traditional sampling. 

```{r example_1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(eDNAjoint)
data(gobyData)
# run the joint model with two covariates
goby.fit <- jointModel(data = gobyData, cov=c('Filter_time','Salinity'), 
                       family = 'poisson', p10priors = c(1,20), q=FALSE)
```

And then this model fit can be accessed to do things like summarize the posterior distribution for the probability of a false positive detection, $p_{10}$:

```{r example_2}
# summarize p10 posterior
jointSummarize(goby.fit$model, par = 'p10')
```

Or to find the number of eDNA samples and traditional survey samples necessary to detect presence of the species at a given expected catch rate:

```{r example_3}
# find the number of samples necessary to detect presence with 0.9 probability at the mean covariate values, 
# if the expected catch rate (mu) is 0.1, 0.5, or 1 individuals/traditional survey unit.
detectionCalculate(goby.fit$model, mu = c(0.1,0.5,1), 
                   cov.val=c(0,0), probability = 0.9)
```
