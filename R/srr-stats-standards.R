#' All of the following standards initially have `@srrstatsTODO` tags.
#' These may be moved at any time to any other locations in your code.
#' Once addressed, please modify the tag from `@srrstatsTODO` to `@srrstats`,
#' or `@srrstatsNA`, ensuring that references to every one of the following
#' standards remain somewhere within your code.

#' @srrstatsVerbose TRUE
#'
#' @srrstatsTODO {G1.2} *Statistical Software should include a* Life Cycle Statement *describing current and anticipated future states of development.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.4b} *explicit conversion to continuous via `as.numeric()`*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.4d} *explicit conversion to factor via `as.factor()`*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.4e} *explicit conversion from factor via `as...()` functions*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.6} *Software which accepts one-dimensional input should ensure values are appropriately pre-processed regardless of class structures.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.9} *Software should issue diagnostic messages for type conversion in which information is lost (such as conversion of variables from factor to character; standardisation of variable names; or removal of meta-data such as those associated with [`sf`-format](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) data) or added (such as insertion of variable or column names where none were provided).*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.11} *Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular objects which have columns which do not themselves have standard class attributes (typically, `vector`) are appropriately processed, and do not error without reason. This behaviour should be tested. Again, columns created by the [`units` package](https://github.com/r-quantities/units/) provide a good test case.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.12} *Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular objects which have list columns should ensure that those columns are appropriately pre-processed either through being removed, converted to equivalent vector columns where appropriate, or some other appropriate treatment such as an informative error. This behaviour should be tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.4a} *For new methods, it can be difficult to separate out correctness of the method from the correctness of the implementation, as there may not be reference for comparison. In this case, testing may be implemented against simple, trivial cases or against multiple implementations such as an initial R implementation compared with results from a C/C++ implementation.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.4b} *For new implementations of existing methods, correctness tests should include tests against previous implementations. Such testing may explicitly call those implementations in testing, preferably from fixed-versions of other software, or use stored outputs from those where that is not possible.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.4c} *Where applicable, stored values may be drawn from published paper outputs when applicable and where code from original implementations is not available*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.7} **Algorithm performance tests** *to test that implementation performs as expected as properties of data change. For instance, a test may show that parameters approach correct estimates within tolerance as data size increases, or that convergence times decrease for higher convergence thresholds.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.9} **Noise susceptibility tests** *Packages should test for expected stochastic behaviour, such as through the following conditions:*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.9a} *Adding trivial noise (for example, at the scale of `.Machine$double.eps`) to data does not meaningfully change results*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.10} *Extended tests should included and run under a common framework with other tests but be switched on by flags such as as a `<MYPKG>_EXTENDED_TESTS="true"` environment variable.* - The extended tests can be then run automatically by GitHub Actions for example by adding the following to the `env` section of the workflow:
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.11} *Where extended tests require large data sets or other assets, these should be provided for downloading and fetched as part of the testing workflow.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.11a} *When any downloads of additional data necessary for extended tests fail, the tests themselves should not fail, rather be skipped and implicitly succeed with an appropriate diagnostic message.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.12} *Any conditions necessary to run extended tests such as platform requirements, memory, expected runtime, and artefacts produced that may need manual inspection, should be described in developer documentation such as a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `tests/README.md` file.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.3a} *Bayesian Software should document, both in text and examples, how to use the output of previous simulations as starting points of subsequent simulations.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.8} *Enable results of previous runs to be used as starting points for subsequent runs.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.13} *Bayesian Software should enable suppression of messages and progress indicators, while retaining verbosity of warnings and errors. This should be tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.14} *Bayesian Software should enable suppression of warnings where appropriate. This should be tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS3.2} *Provide distinct routines for processing perfectly collinear data, potentially bypassing sampling algorithms*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.4} *Enable computations to be stopped on convergence (although not necessarily by default).*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.6} *Implement tests to confirm that results with convergence checker are statistically equivalent to results from equivalent fixed number of samples without convergence checking.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.7} *Where convergence checkers are themselves parametrised, the effects of such parameters should also be tested. For threshold parameters, for example, lower values should result in longer sequence lengths.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.1} *Return values should include appropriate metadata on types (or classes) and dimensions of input data*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.2} *Bayesian Software should either return the input function or prior distributional specification in the return object; or enable direct access to such via additional functions which accept the return object as single argument.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.4} *Where multiple checkers are enabled, Bayesian Software should return details of convergence checker used*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.5} *Appropriate diagnostic statistics to indicate absence of convergence should either be returned or immediately able to be accessed.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.0} *Software should implement a default `print` method for return objects*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.1} *Software should implement a default `plot` method for return objects*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.5} *Software may provide abilities to plot both sequences of posterior samples and distributional estimates together in single graphic*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS7.0} *Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of parametric estimates of a prior distribution*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS7.1} *Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of a prior distribution in the absence of any additional data or information*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS7.2} *Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of a expected posterior distribution given a specified prior and some input data*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS7.3} *Bayesian software should include tests which demonstrate and confirm the scaling of algorithmic efficiency with sizes of input data.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS7.4} *Bayesian software should implement tests which confirm that predicted or fitted values are on (approximately) the same scale as input values.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS7.4a} *The implications of any assumptions on scales on input objects should be explicitly tested in this context; for example that the scales of inputs which do not have means of zero will not be able to be recovered.*

#' @srrstatsNA {G1.4a} There are no non-exported functions.
#' @srrstatsNA {G1.6} This software makes no performance claims.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.5} There are no inputs of type 'factor' in this software.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.14a,G2.14b,G2.14c} NAs in data input are meaningful and should not create an error, nor be imputed
#' @srrstatsNA {G3.1} No covariance methods are used in this software.
#' @srrstatsNA {G3.1a} No covariance methods are used in this software.
#' @srrstatsNA {G4.0} There are no functions that write to local files
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.0} This software is applicable to specific data (i.e., data from environmental DNA and traditional surveys), so NIST datasets would not be applicable
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.3b} This software uses Stan that implements only one type of algorithm (HMC/NUTS)
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.5} This software enables convergence checks through interaction with other packages, but does not enable multiple types of convergence checks itself necessary for comparison
#' @srrstatsNA {BS4.1} This software is not presenting a new sampler
#' @srrstatsNA {BS2.9} This software uses rstan's sampling, which ensures different seeds are used (from rstan's sampling() documentation: "Even if multiple chains are used, only one seed is needed, with other chains having seeds derived from that of the first chain to avoid dependent samples")
#' @srrstatsNA {BS2.10} This software ensures that the same seed is not passed to multiple computational chains
